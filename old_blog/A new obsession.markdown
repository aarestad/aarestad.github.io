A new obsession
===============

-------------------------

Too often over the last few months, I've found myself obsessing over someone. Not in the sense of "oh god, I wish I could be with them", even though they have invariably been women, but in the sense of "wow, they're so amazing, I need to remain friends with them". I meet these people and then get it in my head that, unless I remain close personal friends with them, I am somehow less of a good person. Well, I intend for that to change as of now. Whenever, I get the urge to obsess over someone, I'm going to direct my obsessions to Drew Barrymore.

Seriously, why not? She's pretty, funny, got a great smile, and would totally date me if she knew me. I can cook up elaborate fantasies about me and her and never have it be awkward, since the probability that I will ever actually meet her is about 0. No harm done. Easy as pie.

But yeah, that's my goal. Last night, as I was mulling this over in my head, it seemed to work out so well. A lot of clouds were lifted from my head and things seemed fairly easy to deal with now. My hope is that I can perpetuate this feeling and not have to worry about future obsessions... hopefully.
