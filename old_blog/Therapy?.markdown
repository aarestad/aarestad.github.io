OK, I have a little secret to tell you guys. If you go to my <a href="http://northwestern.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2414491">Facebook profile</a> (which you can probably only access if you're an NU or Loyola student), you'll see a lot of different artists under my "Favorite Music" section:

Pretty hip list, huh? I have a confession, though: There's one band I've been listening to a lot lately; a lot more than any of the above bands. <a href="http://www.linkinpark.com/">Linkin Park</a>.

*gasp*

Well, there goes my street cred. OK, so Linkin Park has the artistic integrity of <a href="http://www.thomaskinkade.com/">Thomas Kinkade</a>. But listening to them is great catharsis. And no, their lyrics don't quite stack up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost">Robert Frost</a>. But here's a bit from their song "<a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Linkin%20Park%20Lyrics/Papercut%20Lyrics.html">Papercut</a>":
<blockquote><em>It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin</em></blockquote>
To me, that sounds like a perfect description of depression. The whirlwind inside of your head blowing all your thoughts around, scrambling your perceptions, distoring them to a darker, more sinister meaning, while evil voices inside of you egg you on - "everyone knows you're stupid"; "just give up, it's not worth it"; "you're just a loser".

Mind you, I have never been, nor am I currently, clinically depressed. I have suffered through some periods that resemble it, but never the proper, full-blown depressiveness that I've seen in others. But I've had enough troubles, especially related to my fight to find myself. Throughout college, I recognized that I didn't do well in large crowds and/or with people I didn't know very well. Once I got comfortable with my friends, I was able to cut loose a bit more and be me. Things started to get a little more crazy when I started <a href="http://www.lutheranvolunteercorps.org/">LVC</a> and it was, all of a sudden, my job to be super-social around a whole bunch of different kinds of people - kids, adults at the church, fellow volunteers. Things got steadily worse as the year dragged on. Things finally got so bad that I sought out psychological care. I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder by a psychologist at UIC, and got a prescription for <a href="http://www.paxil.com/">Paxil</a> (aka <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/parox.htm">paroxetine hydrochloride</a>). To this day, I take 30 mg daily - a smallish dose that keeps me on the straight and narrow.

I also started counseling while in LVC. I started off with one guy who I saw off and on for about a year, but it never really quite worked for me. I mean, he was kind, but the counseling didn't quite take for me. Later I saw a guy at UIC who also was the psychologist who dispensed my prescription. That was almost worse: he was very clinical, and I didn't feel much empathy from him. After that, I gave up therapy for a while, which was just as well: things were OK at work and school, and I wasn't feeling too much stress.

Things turned as I started a summer research assistantship at NU last summer, with the same professor who was to be my Ph. D. research advisor starting in the fall. About a month in, I realized that the work I was doing was dreadfully boring to me, and I was starting to question whether I should just cut my losses and quit school before I even started. No, that didn't seem right. I had a free year of school ahead of me, essentially all expenses paid - why throw that away on account of a nervous tic in my stomach?

So it was time to get back into therapy/counseling/whatever-you-call-it. I set up an appointment with an on-staff psychologist at NU, who then referred me to an excellent counselor in downtown Evanston. I immediately felt much more at ease with her; within a few sessions, I was really starting to break through and be truly honest. That, of course, is the hardest thing about counseling BY FAR: being honest and saying what you're truly thinking. When I learned that lesson, a lot of good things started to happen.

Blargh! This entry is going to take forever to finish. Perhaps I should actually go into more detail about my year at NU before finishing up the counseling side of things. Yeah. So I'll hang this up for now....

to be continued.
