<p class="has-drop-cap">A recent <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/welcome-hustletown-hustle-culture-took-advertising/">article</a> I found via Hacker News talked about "hustle culture", also called "struggle porn" (by someone who approves of it!). This is the idea that merely working hard is not even enough anymore - the <a href="https://technode.com/2016/10/08/996-china-startup-productivity/">9/9/6</a> devotees in China, for example, are just posers according to this mindset.

Ponderous <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-having-side-hustle-essential-your-career-matt-dodaro/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-made-7500-as-a-side-hustle-1324e7e7be80">Medium</a> articles. Hustle hustle #hustle. It's an end to itself.</p>

<p>While this particular article was about the hustle culture in the ad industry, talking about "side projects" has been <em>de rigueur</em> in hacker talk for a while now, at least for most of my career. The idea is that you have to love what you do (in this case, programming) <em>so much</em> that a mere 9-5 workday is not sufficient.</p>
