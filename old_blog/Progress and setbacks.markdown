The past couple of weeks have been dominated by news about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by an explosion in an oil rig owned by BP and its subsequent collapse. This has obviously caused a lot of people to get upset about the state of current and future oil rigs, and positions are starting to harden on both sides of the debate on whether we should further exploration in current areas held by the federal government. The problem I'm seeing is that debate on both sides is not well-reasoned
