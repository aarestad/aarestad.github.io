Choking on a thought

My bad health experiences from this past week have brought to light an interesting metaphor for my bad mental health as well. The last couple of nights I've been lying awake feeling depressed about my friendship with Jen and Kat. What's odd about this is that they have not said a single world to give me a real reason to think that our friendship is damaged, especially with Kat. Yet I keep dwelling on it. Night after night, I've been imagining myself saying, hey look, I know you want to say that we can't be friends any more, that you hate me and are disappointed by me. So just say it... please.

It reminds me of my friendship with Tanya. She was always way too busy to talk to me. I would try to call her and reconnect with her, invariably leaving her a message asking her to call me back. None would be forthcoming. Finally, she would start making visits to Chicago, and not even bother to call me or let me know she was in town. I felt extremely left out and sad. What had I done to be let down like this?

With Kat, I know she's very, very busy. And yet I continue to fear that she's abandoning me. She's finally had enough of my stupidity, and is just going to talk to Kat from now on, ignoring me, or at the very least just gladhandling me. Eh, it's stupid. I'll write more later - I don't feel like writing any more.
