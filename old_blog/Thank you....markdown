...to those people who've been sending me supportive notes lately. I appreciate it more than you'll ever know that, wow, I actually do matter to some people! I mean, it's not like I've every been totally abandoned. I have an amazing family with a mom and dad that have done nothing but love me and care for me all these years... yet I get stuck in these moments of depression. It just goes to show you that depression isn't about whether or not you're smart or thinking straight or whatever - it's dictated by plain old biochemistry.

I'll be seeing my therapist again on Saturday, and we'll work out the next steps on fighting this stuff. While I have been feeling much more cheerful (and much less sick!) these last few days, I just want to be careful and not assume that everything will be fine forever.

So again, thank you all.
