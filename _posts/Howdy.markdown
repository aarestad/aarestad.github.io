Hey folks. Well, I'm trying my hand at blogging again. There's a lot to talk about, since things have changed quite a bit for me in this past year or so, but I'll give it my best shot.

I now work for Orbitz! I'm a "Java Test Engineer" for them, meaning I will basically be writing code that tests code. This means I need to learn everything about everything - a daunting task, but we'll see how it works out.

More to come soon, of course. I'm glad you stopped by. :)
