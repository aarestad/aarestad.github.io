I've been banned from panda-djork.com

Wow. I guess that's it. Butai made some thread about Karazhan and made a snide comment about how we banned Mallrat because "he took matters into his own hands" or whatever. I made a terse post about how, no, what he did fucked up our planned Kara run. Evidently that was a bannable offense.

Anyway, to my remaining Panda friends, you know who you are, and I still love you guys. To the other Pandas I don't know, good luck. And to the person who banned me (whichever officer you are) and the other unnamed officers who continue to slather hate on me for no apparent reason, fuck you. I was nothing but nice and awesome to you guys for months. I decided to take a different turn when it comes to raiding, and I've been met with hatred and loathing from certain people at every turn. I raid with you for 8 months, and the minute I leave (with almost 300 net positive DKP), you have the fucking gall to call me&#160; a LOOT WHORE? You had better take a good hard look at yourselves and figure out why you are so hateful and crabby. It has driven a LOT of very good people from Panda Attack, including me and many of my friends. I hope you're proud of taking what some good people like Ikillah and Synic built up and driving it straight into the ground. So fuck off forever.
