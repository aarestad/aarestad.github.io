Boring, stormy day

Morning of 11 September. 5 years since I nearly drove my car off the Northwest Tollway on my way to work listening to what was going on in NYC and DC on WBBM. 99 times out of 100, I tire of WBBM's rapid-fire, 500-WPM style of news delivery, but the style suited the fast-moving events of that day quite well. Strictly speaking, we were patched into a live feed of WCBS from NYC, but they have the same style. It was about 8:45 AM our time. The rumors were flying fast and furious. Was it a prop plane or a jet that had hit the WTC? How many planes were missing? Was there one heading for the White House?

Now we know the full extent of the truth. I was lucky enough not to know anyone who died that day, but two of my friends, Kris and Kat, did.&#160; I cannot imagine what emotions they must be dealing with today. On top of that, it's Kris's birthday. Yeesh.

In any case, here we are. Besides the date, it's actually a rather glum day. My co-worker is out of the office, so I'm pretty much by myself all day here. I'll try to get some stuff accomplished, but it's looking like a tiring, low-energy day. Eh.

In any case, just wanted to assure any of you reading this (all 0 of you, I'm sure :/) that I'm alive.
