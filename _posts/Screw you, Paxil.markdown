Screw you, Paxil

Strictly speaking, <a title="SSRIs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a> are not addictive, but trying to discontinue its use can result in a condition known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor#Discontinuation_syndrome">discontinuation syndrome</a>". Of all the SSRIs, Paxil, or <a title="Paroxetine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxetine">paroxetine hydrochloride</a>, is the most potent, and leads to the most severe cases of this syndrome. I know this first-hand since I've taken it for over seven years to combat social anxiety disorder as well as mild depressive symptoms. When I started experiencing more depressive thoughts in the past month, I decided it was time to up my prescription to 40 mg from the previous low 20 mg dose I was taking before. Last night, as I went to take my dose, I discovered that the night before, I had used up the last of the Paxil I had on-hand. I knew this would probably mean bad things for me today... and I was right.

For me, even going 36 hours without a dose of Paxil can result in a great deal of extra depression and hyper-sensitivity to emotions. Just this afternoon, a simple thing caused me to spin out of control and to the point of tears. It was not a negative thing at all, not hardly, but it brought up some terrible memories, and caused me to spend an hour or so just staring blankly into space. It is incredibly frustrating to deal with these negative feelings creeping back into my life. Noone deserves this sort of mental torture I put myself through... and yet I do it.

One thing I talk to my therapist about is how I put most of the negative aspects of a relationship on myself. That is, I don't spend a whole lot of time stewing over what others have done to me, but rather I tend to spend the time thinking of what wrong I have done to others. Even the act of apologizing doesn't help - when it's not received well, or outright ignored, I find myself simply befuddled and upset at myself. If only I hadn't blown up that one time! If only I knew what to say to make it up to them. If only I wasn't such a jerk. If only I wasn't such an idiot. If only I wasn't bad...

And so it goes, leaving me feeling like the worst person on earth. I'm self-centered, lazy, thoughtless, jerky. I'm terrible with people. I will always be alone.

I find that these thoughts just refuse to go away altogether, and they get amplified when I am low on my drugs. It's just flat-out frustrating. Others have gotten through much worse thoughts and situations than me, and yet I continue to wallow and tell myself how awful I am. Others have attempted suicide, some succeeded. I have had my share of thoughts, but never had the guts to act on them. I've never been quite depressed enough to really be truly "depressed", so instead, I just feel lazy. I get scared, I feel unable to interact with anyone. I am a failure of a human being.

...see, but I'm not. I cognitively know that my struggles are the same ones everyone goes through, from the shyest guy on the block to alpha-males like Donald Trump - everyone has doubts, fears, that sort of thing. Days like today, though, make it feel like I'm the worst person on earth.
