Why am I sad?

Why am I sad?  Is it because I'm truly upset about possibly losing a friend, or is it because I'm thinking just of myself? When I look at why I'm sad, it seems to be more because this person i thought would provide attention and caring for me is no longer doing so. It's not so much sympathy as a feeling of being unfulfilled. Like being a kid and getting caught with your hand in the cookie jar. You're not sorry about what you did, you're sorry about being caught. I'm sorry about what I did, but inasmuch as it had negative consequences rather than the actions themselves. I'm upset that she's having a difficult time, but evidently only because it's taking her out of my life.

What should I feel? What should I do? One thing I have to remind myself is that I can't "own" this whole situation all by myself. It's too easy for me to think that this is all my fault. If I hadn't sent those two text messages, it would all be OK. She has a part in this too. I have already given my apology in an email. She can choose to read it or not. But I've done my part. There are two possible outcomes. She continues to ignore me and essentially breaks off the friendship. That would be hard, but essentially I can say, well, if she's that shallow that she will end a friendship over this one thing, then it wasn't worth it. Or, she'll eventually respond, and things will return to somewhat normalcy.

Either way, it's out of my hands. I have tried to be the best person I can be for 6 months, but for 10 minutes, I was not a good person. I hope she'll remember the 6 months over the 10 minutes... eventually. Even if she doesn't, I know I am loved by many people who mean a lot more to me, and always will. I guess it's just time to move on...
