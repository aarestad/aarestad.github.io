Well, let's see:
<ul>
	<li>Lack of energy and motivation</li>
	<li>Reduced appetite</li>
	<li>Changing sleeping patterns</li>
	<li>Almost complete lack of sense of humor</li>
	<li>and, of course, lots of sadness</li>
</ul>
I'm no psychiatrist, but it certainly sounds like I have clinical depression. The sickness has caused me to be in isolation for a long, long time, and it's finally starting to affect me in profound ways. I've been having flashes of good moments, but I can't seem to perpetuate them. The worst part is trying to explain myself to everyone I know. My friends and family mean well, but they try to reason with me, and it's clear that I can't be reasoned with.

I've also thought about suicide more often in the past week or so than I usually do. Mind you, plans never seem to come to mind, although I did even start making plans last night. I never get any farther than thinking about it, though - it's as if a mental block sets in preventing me from going any further, protecting myself. Believe me, I'm quite grateful for it.

Anyway, I'm going to call my therapist today and leave a message with her. If there's anyone out there reading it, I have one favor to ask of you. Please just write me a little note or something - comment here on this blog, email, something - letting me know that you're out there thinking of me. The largest distortion in my mind right now is that noone cares if I live or die; my life matters to noone. I know it sounds selfish, but please remind me that I matter.
